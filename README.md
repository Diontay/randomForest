Apply the Random Forest Technique
Apply the random forest technique to classify the traffic types and extract variables of importance. (For variable importance, in Python there's a way to select the important featuresâ€”plot it as a histogram.) The random forest algorithm provides the variable list with an order of importance for the classification accuracy that was achieved.

As the next step, by eliminating one feature at a time, from the least important to the most important, get accuracies for the random forest and use them to decide how much dimensionality reduction can be achieved. In other words, find the subset of features (subspace) that gives similar accuracy as the entire feature space. Use quantitative measures (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, etc.). Also, use misclassification and out-of-bag errors as measures to interpret and discuss the results.
